# Fundamental-Matrix
The fundamental matrix F completely describes the epipolar geometry of a pair of images. 8-Point Algorithm is the simplest method for estimating the fundamental matrix.

a. Using one of the given pairs of images, establish 8 point correspondences.
b. Normalize the coordinates of the correspondences.
c. Using the normalized coordinates of the correspondences, compute the fundamental matrix.
d. Perform denormalization so as to find the fundamental matrix corresponding to the original data.
